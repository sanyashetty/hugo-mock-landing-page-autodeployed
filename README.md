Homework 2 for CIS 3500

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys a Hugo website to GitHub Pages. Whenever code is pushed to the main branch, the workflow checks out the repository, sets up the Hugo environment, compiles the static files, and publishes them to the gh-pages branch. This allows the website to be hosted directly on GitHub Pages using the gh-pages branch as the source.
